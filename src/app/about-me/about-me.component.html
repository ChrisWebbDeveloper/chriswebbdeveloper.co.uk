    <h1 class="mb-4">I'm Chris, a full-stack developer</h1>

    <p>Having worked in web development for the past 5 years, my passion for the industry has only grown, as have my skills.</p>
    <p>Working as a Product Developer for the NHS, I have worked to develop robust JavaScript applications that work in a 3rd party framework to provide integral patient support. I have also developed several full-stack applications tailored to the customer's needs. This has given me experience with working with PHP to create RESTful APIs, connecting to a wide variety of databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server & MongoDB), as well as Angular, TypeScript, jQuery, SASS and HTML5 on the front-end to provide a useful and intuitive user experience.</p>
    <p>As well as web applications, I have also designed and deployed hybrid applications (Ionic Framework) to work alongside these products, also using Angular. These skills I have gained have allowed me to work to mentor and pass on this knowledge to fellow developers in my team.</p>
    <p>This passion has also carried over to my personal projects, where I have pushed the boundaries of my knowledge. I have experimented with Laravel and SQLite to build a simple website backend, using React as a clean and user-friendly front-end. I have worked with ASP.NET Core and C# to build workable web applications. I have also used Entity Framework in this to explore what is possible with building databases. This knowledge of C# and design practice I have also used to try my hand at game development, initially in Unity and now in Godot.</p>
    <p>Regardless of what I craft, I aim to bring the same passion for tinkering and problem-solving.</p>
